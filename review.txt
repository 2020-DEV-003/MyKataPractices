 
 
 1, Maintain code coverage as 100%. Try to write junit for main method also.
 2, Delete unused file, Spring-module.xml 
 3, Method must have 4 to 5 lines only.
 4, Try to split up code in many class with proper name. 
 5, Change logger level to Error in Catch block
 6, Move all hardCoded value in constant file, ex: "user.dir", "," 
 7, Give proper naming convention. Correction need in "Properties p "
 8,  Remove redundant if condition for method leapYear 
 
 	if ( iYear % 4 == 0 && !(iYear % 100 == 0) && (iYear % 400 == 0)) {
					bLeapFlag = true;
		}
		
 9,  Remove static keyword for isLeapYear and isValidate methods.
 10, Specify Access modifier for Logger declaration, For logger it should be private. 
 11, No need to specify default value for primitive variable, Example boolean
 12, Remove sysout in all files, In test class we having sysout 
 13, Better change below code like 
 
 !"".equals(CConstants.YEARS_INPUT_FILENAME_KEY) 
 to
 !CConstants.YEARS_INPUT_FILENAME_KEY.equals("")
 
				
 14, Good to use ini file instead of Properties file.. but failed to use core feature of ini over properties. ( Here you can use one ini file over 4 ini file )

 sample code :
 
 
			import org.ini4j.*;

			Wini ini = new Wini(new File("C:\\Users\\sdkca\\Desktop\\myinifile.ini"));
            int age = ini.get("owner", "age", int.class);
            double height = ini.get("owner", "height", double.class); 
			
			
 15, Need to close FileInputStream or use try resource. 
 16, Place static block before methods
 
 17, Give comments on all methods and class
 
 18, Remove throws IOException in main method.
 
 19, try to write Dummy unit test case for CConstant class
 20, In Readme.md file add point "how to run the application" and specify maven commands to download jar. (if possible mention java version also)
 21, In Readme.md software requirement not need SONAR.
 22, In pom.xml group id is mention as "com.bnp" but actual package named as "com.kata".
 23, Better put all ini file in one Folder 
 24, Always main method should have try catch and remaining method should throw appropriate exception .
