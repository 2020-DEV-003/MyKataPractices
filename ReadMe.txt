CaseStudy : Leap Years

Acceptance Criteria:

1. All years divisible by 400 ARE leap years (so, for example, 2000 was indeed a leap year),
2. All years divisible by 100 but not by 400 are NOT leap years (so, for example, 1700, 1800, and 1900 were NOT leap years, NOR will 2100 be a leap year),
3. All years divisible by 4 but not by 100 ARE leap years (e.g., 2008, 2012, 2016),
4. All years not divisible by 4 are NOT leap years (e.g. 2017, 2018, 2019).

Coding Logic
            As provided program to achieve find leap year based on given Acceptance Criteria.
    
       Logic Implementation :
                   
1. We are reading Years from YearsInput.ini file (It may contain valid or Invalid Leap Years)

2. Then validate whether input is valid Year pattern or Not 

3. Finally, check whether input Year is Leap Year or Not and showing into display as well.  

Software Requirements:

1. JDK
2. IDE
3. MAVEN




Setup Configuration :
1. I kept  YearsInput.ini file in project classpath and it contains key=value format.
2. Please write years into YearsInput.ini file 
3. Please execute the program with Valid input file.
Note :  
We have kept CConstants.java file , here you can change  YearsInput.ini file if you want run with different file name but should follow above 3 points.
